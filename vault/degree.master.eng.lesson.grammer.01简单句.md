| ------------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| 一般现在                       | ed   |      | will | would    |

### 情态

>  **情态动词**+**动词原型**
>
> You **must** **pass** the exam!

| **表情绪**  **或态度** | **现在时**       | **过去时** |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 必须                   | must / (have to) |            |
| 应该                   | shall            | should     |

### 语态

#### 被动结构

> 谓语动词的变化：**被动语态**

be+done（by）

- be: 变时态、变单复数
- done 表动作

示例：

- 他每天被打。	He **is beaten** every day.
- 他昨天被打了。	He **was beaten** yesterday.
- 他明天将要被打。	He **will be beaten** tomorrow.
- 他正在被打。	He **is being beaten** now.
- 他已经被打了。	He **has been beaten**.

学会分辨主动还是被动

|      | 过去      | 现在| 将来 |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 一般 | was/were done | am/are/is done | will be done |
| 进行 | was/were being done | am/are/is being done |  |
| 完成 | had been done | have/has been done |              |

#### 否定

> 谓语动词的否定

- am not…/ is not… ( =**isn’t**…)/ are not… ( =**aren’t**…)
- will not do… = (**won’t** do…)
- should not do = (**shouldn’t** do)
- can not do(=**can’t** do)
- do not do= (**don’t** do)
- did not do= (**didn’t** do)

#### 强调

**do/does/did + v.**(原型）确实做某事

But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future. 

[英语一2005 Text 2]
